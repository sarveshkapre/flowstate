# Product Context

## Product Name

Flowstate

## Thesis

Flowstate is an OpenAI-native platform for high-value visual/document workflows:
- extraction
- validation
- human review
- automation back into business systems

## Why Now

Teams often stitch together separate OCR, labeling, workflow, and monitoring tools.
Flowstate unifies these with modern UI and OpenAI-native capabilities.

## Initial ICP

- SMB and mid-market operations/finance teams
- agencies and integrators deploying document automation
- internal tooling teams replacing manual QA pipelines

## Initial Wedge Use Case

Receipt/invoice extraction + validation + human review queue.

## Next Build Priorities

- Flow Builder v1: visual no-code pipeline composition and deployable versioned endpoints.
- Dataset + run versioning: reproducible experiments and regression replay (`flow version X` vs `dataset version Y`).
- Structured review UI: field-level decisions, evidence mapping, and failure reason taxonomy.
- Active learning v2: hard-example mining that prioritizes low-confidence and high-impact failures.
- Edge runner v1: RTSP/webcam local runtime with offline buffering and event sync.
