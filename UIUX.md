# UI/UX Direction

## Design Goals

- Fast and focused workflows for operations teams.
- Clear visual hierarchy with low cognitive overhead.
- Zero-clutter screens for annotation/review and extraction QA.

## Visual Language

- Typography: `Space Grotesk` (primary), `IBM Plex Mono` (data/technical).
- Style: clean industrial interface, subtle contrast, no ornamental gradients.
- Color roles: neutral surfaces + strong status colors for confidence and alerts.

## Interaction Rules

- Every critical action should be reachable in <= 2 clicks.
- Keyboard shortcuts for review queues and labeling actions.
- Perceived latency target: UI feedback in < 100ms for local interactions.

## Component Priorities

- Data table with virtualization and inline filters.
- Queue panel for low-confidence review tasks.
- Artifact viewer (image/PDF) + extraction result side-by-side.
- Confidence heat and validation badges.

## Mobile Baseline

- Read-only monitoring and approvals supported on mobile.
- Heavy annotation workflows are desktop-first.
