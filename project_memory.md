# Project Memory

## 2026-02-16

- Repository scaffold created from scratch.
- Selected stack: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind + OpenAI SDK + worker service.
- Added foundational docs for product, UX, and agent behavior.

## Decisions

- OpenAI APIs only for model capabilities.
- Monorepo architecture from day one.
- Start with extraction and review workflows before broader CV parity.
